# Counter App

A simple React-based counter application demonstrating state management and CSS transitions with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement**: Adjust the counter value with smooth transitions.
- **Reset**: Reset the counter to zero.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Text color changes and zoom effects based on actions.
- **Alert Messages**: Display alerts when limits are reached.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **clsx**: A utility for constructing `className` strings conditionally.
